### Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Tribute Page - TODO

* I can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and I should get some practice with plain CSS. I can use Bootstrap or SASS if I choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at my own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!
* **User Story #1:** My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements. __DONE__
* **User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug"). __DONE__
* **User Story #3:** I should see a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`. __DONE__
* **User Story #4:** Within the `img-div` element, I should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`. __DONE__
* **User Story #5:** Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`. __DONE__
* **User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page. __DONE__
* **User Story #7:** I should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`). __DONE__
* **User Story #8:** The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size. __DONE__
* **User Story #9:** The `img` element should be centered within its parent element. __DONE__

##### Later - at the end: I will make this page responsive to mobile, tablet;
##### Using HTML, CSS, without framework and any libraries
