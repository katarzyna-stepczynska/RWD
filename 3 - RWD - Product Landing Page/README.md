### Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Product Landing Page - TODO

* I can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and I should get some practice with plain CSS. I can use Bootstrap or SASS if I choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at my own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!
* **User Story #1:** My product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`. __DONE__
